                    <h2>Course Schedule to .ics Website</h2>
                    <p>This was the first project I made during my first year at the University of Guelph. 
                        The website allows you to enter course codes and it spits out a .ics file, which can 
                        be imported into any calendar application of your choice. This project started as a 
                        fork of another project based on courses at the University of Guelph: https://github.com/AlphaCloudX/Schedule-Optimizer. 
                        This project calculates the most optimal schedule based on courses given to the program. To do this, 
                        the author had to scrape the data from all the courses on webAdvisor. As a user of his program, 
                        I saw an opportunity to solve an issue that many university students face during the first few days 
                        of a semester, adding your lectures to your calendar application. With his data, it was now feasible 
                        to create a program that could import your courses into your calendar at the click of a button. 
                        The issue, however, was figuring out how to do that. At first, I considered using the Google Calendar 
                        API, however, this would force the user to sign into their Google account, as well as not working for 
                        other calendar apps, and I know many who use the default calendar app provided by Apple. Eventually, 
                        I discovered the iCalendar file format. This would allow my program to support every popular calendar 
                        app and forgo forcing the user to sign in. However, figuring out how to generate such a file proved to 
                        be somewhat difficult. To create this program, I had to learn a whole new standard, and making a program 
                        to dynamically generate such a file would prove to be an obstacle. Fortunately, I discovered that Python 
                        had several libraries dedicated to generating these files for you, taking the burden off your shoulders. 
                        First, I tried ics.py: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ics/">https://pypi.org/project/ics/</a>, 
                        this library did not require you to know anything 
                        about the internals of the file format, as well as being intuitive to use. It follows the “pythonic” ideology, 
                        meaning that it is built to follow the conventions and structure of the Python language. However, it was 
                        missing one key feature, recurring events. This feature was particularly important for a program dedicated 
                        to importing a course schedule, as lectures and labs repeat weekly at the. Checking the GitHub repo for the 
                        library, you can see that somebody back in 2013 had requested support for the same feature that I wanted: 
                        <a href="https://github.com/ics-py/ics-py/issues/14">https://github.com/ics-py/ics-py/issues/14</a>. This means that the developers of the library could not, or 
                        would not implement this feature for 12 years, likely meaning that the feature would never be completed. 
                        So, I had no choice but to find another library. The second library that I tried was significantly less 
                        intuitive to use and required knowledge about the file format, however, it did support recurring events. 
                        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/">https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/</a> Eventually, I was able to finish my command line program, adding onto 
                        the project that AlphaCloudX created, allowing the user to import their schedule after optimizing it. 
                        After this, I created a pull request on his repo and was able to contribute to the project that he made. 
                        However, I realized that the average student, especially those who aren’t in Computer Science, would not 
                        want to deal with the hassle of running a command line program. Therefore, I decided to separate the export 
                        feature into a website of its own. To do this, I had to learn a Python “microframework”, Flask which would 
                        allow me to run Python code on the web. Development of the website generally proceeded smoothly after I had 
                        learned enough Flask for a text box and a button. However, to make the website accessible to the rest of the 
                        world, I had to host it somewhere. I decided on pythonanywhere: <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">https://www.pythonanywhere.com/</a>, which allowed 
                        me to host my website for free. Deploying my website was an eye-opening experience. First of all, it made me 
                        thankful that I had switched my main operating system on my laptop to Linux, as setting up my website required 
                        extensive use of the operating system. Secondly, I had to cope with the differences between the way the project 
                        was set up on my computer and the way it was set up on Pythonanywhere’s servers. Eventually, I was able to get 
                        the website set up and working and I shared my website with my friends to use just in time before the second 
                        semester began, and I received around 100 page visits. This entire project was completed during the break between 
                        my first and second semesters, and I am pretty proud to have created something that was of genuine use to students at the University of Guelph.

                    <h2>Jpeg Quantization Table Editor</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every Jpeg image has something called a Quantization Table, which is a table used to quantize Discrete Cosine Transform 
                        coefficients. These are used in Jpeg images to adjust the quality of the image. They are stored within the binary data 
                        of the file and can be edited with a hex editor. They are meant to be manipulated with an algorithm, but when edited manually, 
                        some … freaky things can happen to the image. After messing around with Jpegs with a hex editor, I sought to create a more 
                        convenient way to edit the quantization tables of an image. Despite what is listed in the projects section, I first made my 
                        Jpeg Quantization Table Editor in Godot. Godot is an open-source game engine that happened to have a robust enough UI system 
                        that allowed me to create working desktop applications. I started and completed the Godot version of the project sometime during 
                        high school but I was ultimately somewhat unsatisfied with the final product. Firstly, the project was somewhat basic and unintuitive 
                        to use and was never deployed as a full desktop application. That meant anybody who wanted to use my program had to go through the 
                        trouble of loading my project through the Godot editor, instead of just running an executable like a normal program. However, in my 
                        senior year of high school came an opportunity to revamp the project. Due to a somewhat unorthodox teacher, I was allowed, as a final 
                        project of my Computer Science class, to create whatever I wanted. Therefore, I decided to remake my project in the language of the 
                        course, Java. I had to use a framework called Processing, geared towards beginners of programming. Using this opportunity, I revamped 
                        my entire project, making it easier to use, adding a quality slider and making the images easier to view. However, the problem of being 
                        undeployable was still there. Since Processing was geared towards beginners, projects made in Processing were never meant to be used by 
                        people other than yourself. Then came the second semester of university, after I had finished the ScheduleToIcs website, I was looking 
                        for another project to work on. Despite the editor's half-baked status, I still thought it was an interesting concept, and I was almost 
                        certainly the first person to have thought of creating a program for editing the quantization tables for Jpeg files, so I couldn’t resist 
                        remaking it for a third time. This time, I used Qt, a cross-platform application development framework for C++. This version of the project 
                        is the most fully formed yet, users are now able to import and export their images with the UI, and finally, the project is deployed on both 
                        Windows and Linux. The experience of deploying a desktop application turned out to be much more involved than I thought, with differences between 
                        Windows and Linux. Turns out, you need to actually own a system running Windows to deploy to Windows and likewise for Linux. That is why I was 
                        unable to create a version for Macintosh because I did not own an Apple product that ran it. Furthermore, deploying on Linux added an extra layer 
                        of complication, due to the sheer number of distros. Therefore, I decided to make my program an AppImage, which ran on all distros. The Qt version 
                        of my Quantization Table Editor is the most complete and accessible version, which I would be proud to have anybody interested in how Jpegs work, 
                        and use.
